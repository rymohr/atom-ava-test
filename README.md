# atom-ava-test

Making unit testing easier by automatically opening test files for the
current source file and running the tests on save.

```
npm install -g ava faucet
apm install atom-ava-test
```

### TODO

- automatically install dependencies
- built-in babel support (for tests and source)
- webpack support (ability to test files relying on webpack module resolution)
- command / shortcut for adding test file for the current file
